# Micro800 Documentation

This repository serves as a collection of improved documentation and practical examples, rewritten from the Connected Components Workbench help files. The goal is to provide clearer, more useful resources for others in my organization, addressing gaps and shortcomings in the original documentation.

Feel free to use these materials as reference aids for your work with Micro800 controllers.
